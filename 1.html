  Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more: <strong> believing in <u>yourself</u>.</strong><br>
  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

  <p>"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love! The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror?"
—Description of Harry's rare nature</p>

  <p>CHAPTER ONE  - THE BOY WHO LIVED.</p>

  Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Privet_Drive" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Privet Drive</a>, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.
   They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

  Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.
   He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.
   Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.
   The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

  The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
   They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.
   Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
   in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.
   The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.
   The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.
   This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away;
   they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
