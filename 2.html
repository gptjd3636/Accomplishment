  <h2>Ron</h2>
  Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more: <strong> believing in <u>yourself</u>.</strong><br>
  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

  <p>"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was Head Boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first."
